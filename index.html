			<h2>Reed & Willow- The Story</h2>
			<p>Ours is a generation of online shoppers. Imagine you buy a pair of shoes online. You receive them, but they aren’t the right size. There is no option of returning them, so you keep them. They lie in your shoe closet, unused and wasted. Next time, when you want to buy shoes online, wouldn’t you buy the right shoes with the right fit for your feet?</p>
			<p>Similarly, when you’re hiring people, how many times have you faced the challenge of “right feet and wrong fit”? </p>
